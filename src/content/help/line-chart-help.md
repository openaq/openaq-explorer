# Latest Readings Chart

The latest readings chart shows hourly measurements from the last 24 hour, 48 hours, 72 hours, 1 week or 30 days, starting from the current moment in time.

For sensors that report measurements at sub-hour intervals an average (mean) of the hour is calculated. The average value will only be shown if the sub-hour measurements have coverage of at least 75%. Hourly averages with less than 75% are determined to not be representative averages. The hourly averages represent the time-ending values, e.g. 10:00AM represents the average value of measurements from 9:01AM to 10:00AM.
