### Pollutants

The OpenAQ database currently ingests the following pollutant data, with a focus on those in **bold**.

- PM<sub>1</sub> - particulate matter 1 microns (μm)
- **PM<sub>2.5</sub> - particulate matter 2.5 microns (μm)**
- PM<sub>4</sub> - particulate matter 4 microns (μm)
- **PM<sub>10</sub> - particulate matter 10 microns (μm)**
- **BC - black carbon particulates, part of PM2.5**
- **O₃ - Ozone gas**
- **CO - Carbon monoxide gas**
- **NO₂ - Nitrogen dioxide gas**
- NO - Nitrogen monoxide gas
- NO<sub>x</sub> - Nitrogen oxides
- **SO₂ - Sulfur dioxide gas**
- CH₄ - Methane gas
- CO₂ - Carbon dioxide gas

### Units of measurement

Measurements of pollutants are reported in a variety of units depending on how the data is reported from the original data provider. The most common units found in the dataset are:

- ppb (parts per million)
- µg/m³ (micrograms per cubic meter)

Units are not normalized in the OpenAQ system, with the exception of converting ppb (parts per billion) to ppm (parts per million). Volume units are not converted to mass units, nor vice versa; they are served as originally reported.
